Calvin was born in Hawaii but eventually landed in Charleston by way of the Outer Banks. Tempered by hurricanes and big waves, Calvin has a passion for coastal life that is only rivaled by his passion to learn and teach. Calvin has taught web development classes to college students and environmental education to K-12 students. As a developer Calvin has worked with a huge range of companies, from The Charleston Museum to the Veterans Administration and Cummins Marine. He has also contributed to the Modernizr project as well as Adobe Brackets.
